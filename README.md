# japanese_voice_to_transcription

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The program detects Japanese speech using stt, the official Flutter support, and outputs the detected speech as text. The program extracts only nouns, a type of part of speech, from the output string.

It also uses a library called Mecab for morphological analysis.

To install Mecab, please refer to the following repository.
